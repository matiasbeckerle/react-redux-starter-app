# React+Redux starter app

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Motivation

Sometimes I've found myself doing the simplest setup for a particular framework/language, specially in the JavaScript world where these days you have tons of good libraries to help you out.

What do I look for? If we are talking about JavaScript then a testing framework, a linting tool and a packaging/building well-known stablished process.

Setting up all these things might take some time so it makes sense to prepare something solid and reuse it. There are a lot of other awesome boilerplate/templates out there. Unfortunately most of them contains a fair amount of stuff that I don't use or need.

The idea is that you only have the minimum to start developing an application with React and Redux, testing, linting, packaging/building included. There is not a backend dependency. There is not a database to set up. And there is not a single CSS framework applied. You're completely free.
